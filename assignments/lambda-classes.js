// CODE here for your Lambda Classes

// First we need a Person class. This will be our base-class
// Person receives name age location all as props
// Person receives speak as a method.
// This method logs out a phrase Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock where name and location are the object's own props

class Person {
    constructor(attr) {
        this.name = attr.name,
        this.age = attr.age,
        this.location = attr.location
    }
    speak() {
        return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}.`;
    }
}

// Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
// Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Instructor has the following unique props:
// specialty what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
// favLanguage i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
// catchPhrase i.e. Don't forget the homies
// Instructor has the following methods:
// demo receives a subject string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
// grade receives a student object and a subject string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'

class Instructor extends Person {
    constructor(attr) {
        super(attr);
        this.specialty = attr.specialty,
        this.favLanguage = attr.favLanguage,
        this.catchPhrase = attr.catchPhrase

    }
    grade(student, subject) {
        return `${student} receives a perfect score on ${subject}.`;
    }
}

// Now we need some students!
// Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// Student has the following unique props:
// previousBackground i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
// className i.e. CS132
// favSubjects. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// Student has the following methods:
// listsSubjects a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
// PRAssignment a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}
// sprintChallenge similar to PRAssignment but logs out student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}

class Student extends Person{
    constructor(attr) {
        super(attr);
        this.previousBackground = attr.previousBackground,
        this.className = attr.className,
        this.favSubjects = attr.favSubjects,
    }
    listsSubjects() {
        return this.favSubjects;
    }
    PRAssignment(subject) {

    }
    sprintChallenge(subject) {
        return `${this.name} has begun sprint challenge on ${subject}.`;
    }
}

// Now that we have instructors and students, we'd be nowhere without our PM's
// ProjectManagers are extensions of Instructors
// ProjectManagers have the following unique props:
// gradClassName: i.e. CS1
// favInstructor: i.e. Sean
// ProjectManagers have the following Methods:
// standUp a method that takes in a slack channel and logs `{name} announces to {channel}, @channel standy times!​​​​​
// debugsCode a method that takes in a student object and a subject and logs out {name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}

class ProjectManagers extends Instructor {
    constructor(attr) {
        super(attr);
        this.gradClassName = attr.gradClassName,
        this.favInstructor = attr.favInstructor,
    }
    standUp(channel) {
        `${this.name} announces to ${channel}, @channel standy times!​​​​​`
    }
